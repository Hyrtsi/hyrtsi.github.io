Bicycling around the world. I can't think of any better way to use my limited lifetime. To explore the hidden gems of the world, learn about new cultures, challenge myself and feel the freedom.

I started bicycling at the age of three or four and I never stopped. I started exploring Finland but then I started doing trips abroad in the Baltics, Mediterranean, East Europe and even New Zealand!

I am dreaming of cycling around the world but I still don't know how. My biggest pain points:

- How to fund the trip?
- Do I have to "ruin" my career in programming by quitting my awesome and well-paying job?
- How to plan the route?
- Is my bicycle and my gear good enough for the trip?
- What happens to my social relationships during the tour?
- Do I want to do it all in one go or split the trip into separate parts and come back to my home in the meantime?
- When to do it?
- Which time of the year do I want to spend in each country? Do I want to try to survive extreme temperatures of -40 or +40 degrees celsius or heavy downpour, floods and landslips during the monsoon?

As you can see I have quite many unknows even though I have bicycled probably tens of thousands of kilometers in Finland and a couple of thousand of kms abroad. But I don't let them stop me. I know that I already have what it takes for the trip. Planning can only make it better. But it is already possible.

I will collect here resources that are useful for me and hopefully are useful to you.
