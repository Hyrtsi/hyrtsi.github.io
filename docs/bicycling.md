Bicycling around the world. I can't think of any better way to use my limited lifetime. To explore the hidden gems of the world, learn about new cultures, challenge myself and feel the freedom.

I started bicycling at the age of three or four and I never stopped. I started exploring Finland but then I started doing trips abroad in the Baltics, Mediterranean, East Europe and even New Zealand!

I am dreaming of cycling around the world but I still don't know how. My biggest pain points:

- How to fund the trip?
- Do I have to "ruin" my career in programming by quitting my awesome and well-paying job?
- How to plan the route?
- Is my bicycle and my gear good enough for the trip?
- What happens to my social relationships during the tour?
- Do I want to do it all in one go or split the trip into separate parts and come back to my home in the meantime?
- When to do it?
- Which time of the year do I want to spend in each country? Do I want to try to survive extreme temperatures of -40 or +40 degrees celsius or heavy downpour, floods and landslips during the monsoon?

As you can see I have quite many unknows even though I have bicycled probably tens of thousands of kilometers in Finland and a couple of thousand of kms abroad. But I don't let them stop me. I know that I already have what it takes for the trip. Planning can only make it better. But it is already possible.

I will collect here resources that are useful for me and hopefully are useful to you.

# Big picture

I love to travel the world. I love bicycling, too. On my last trip from Finland to Romania I got two ideas: a route planning application for bicyclists and my own trip around the world. I had earlier thought that I would be able to do my RTW trip in smaller pieces but now I got frustrated. I have about 4 or 5 weeks of paid holiday each year. I can apply for an unspecified amount of unpaid holiday, too. I can travel 1000km, maybe 2000km max during that time. It doesn't sound too appealing.

- It takes a while to go from bicycle mental mode to working and living in a city and vice versa so long trips are preferred
- Flying is almost certainly required to travel from Finland to anywhere unless I have lots of more time
- It's frustrating to disassemble and package the bicycle for flying
- Many short trips is more expensive than few long trips
- I don't need much money on the tour, maybe 5-10 euros a day on average
- I don't want to travel the same routes every time

so I must try to travel for longer periods of time. At least two months, preferably more at a time. Since most of our planet is water the route must be split to parts and boats, ferries and airplanes must be used. This also means that each one of these journeys can be done separately and I can return back home in between them.

The fastest person to bicycle around the world is Mark Beaumont. He cycled around the world 29000km in 78 and a half days. The slowest person to cycle around the world is Heinz Stucke, who cycled around the world for 50 years. My trip will be something in between probably. Those men have set the boundaries for me.

I have decided that I must maximize the fun, safety and meaning in my trip. I don't have to follow the Guiness World Records rules even though it would be awesome to get my name on the same page with the big boys and girls.

Things that motivate me:
- Travelling countries that none of my friends even know about
- Meeting local people and other cyclists
- Adventuring
- Having a big goal
- Visiting many countries
- Seeing beautiful places

Things that do not motivate me:
- Ugly places
- Crowded and busy streets
- Landmines, war, protests
- Pollution
- Corrupt police
- Trash and broken glass on the streets
- Natural disasters
- Wild animals that try to kill me

It is inevitable that the list of countries I can visit is really low if I want to minimize all risks. Consider [all the horrible things that happened to Heinz Stuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_St%C3%BCcke#Global_bicycle_tour) on his journey. But that doesn't make me want to stay at home. He did survive it so I will survive, too.

# Review on all people who have cycled around the world (or are currently trying to)

Guiness World Record breakers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_world_cycling_record).

Thomas Stevens was the first person to ride a bicycle around the world. It took him three years. He started from San Francisco and worked his way from west to east.

![thomas-stevens]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/thomas-stevens-route.png)

Mark Beaumont has the supported record. His route:

![mark-beaumont]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mark-beaumont.png)

Jenny Graham bicycled around the world totally unsupported. Her route is similar:

![jenny-graham]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/jenny-graham.jpg)

Paola Gianetti finished her 29430km trip in 144 days.

![paola-gianetti]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Gianetti-map.png)


Juliana Buhring did 18000 miles in 152 days visiting 4 continents and 19 countries. Surprisingly little amount of countries don't you think for such a long trip? I couldn't find a picture or a satellite map of her journey but this instead:

Italy is the starting point then:
-France
-Spain
-Portugal
-USA
-New Zealand
-Australia
-Malaysia
-Thailand
-India
-Turkey
-Greece
-Macedonia
-Albania
-Montenegro
-Bosnia
-Croatia
-Slovenia

Nick Sanders has cycled and motorcycled around the world seven times. I could not find his bicycle route for his 1981 or 1984 bike tours.

[Alastair Humphreys](https://alastairhumphreys.com/roundtheworldbybike/) did plan an awesome route. He really did take his time while bicycling 4 years in 4 continents, 60 countries and 46000 miles.

![alastair-humphreys]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/alastair-humphreys.jpg)

Jin from [Universe With Me](https://www.universewithme.com/) has spent her fair time around the world with more than 87000km cycled in 6 continents, 76 countries spanning over 4000 days. Her route can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1O6SspQxUOnoY-vKPOMbJJvAHG48&ll=25.63024166338775%2C117.47976895922443&z=2).

[She's Not Pedalling On The Back](https://shesnotpedallingontheback.com/) did a RTW trip using tandem.

[Harry and Rolie](http://www.sintchristophorus.nl/harry-en-roelie-op-wereldreis-per-pilot-vamos/) chose a quite interesting route.

[Chris Yee](https://www.lifeabundantconsulting.com/blog/2018/9/22/on-our-way) is swimming against the mainstream and bikes from east to west!

[Scott Stoll](https://scottstoll.com/around-the-world-by-bicycle/how-to-ride-a-bicycle-around-the-world/) did this amazing route

# Route planning

There are four big connected bodies of land in the world:
- Afro-Eurasia
- Americas
- Australia
- Antarctica

In addition to this, there are notable islands such as Iceland, the UK, Madagascar, New Zealand, Japan, Greenland and Polynesia to name a few. If it was possible I'd like to visit every single of them. But since my time and money are limited I have to rank everything and pick the ones I am the most curious about.

## Americas

Route planning for Americas is quite straightforward to me so I will start with it. I can choose to go from Alaska to Argentina or to stick with the US of A and go from San Diego to Boston. These lands have been explored with bicycles many many times so I think this would be a no-brainer. Some South American countries could be dangerous and I could face tons of bears in Alaska but I don't worry about that too much.

The route from west to east is around 5000-9000km and the route from south to north is at least 30 000km. [This crazy dude](https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway) did write something about the north to south route.
There are some amazing established routes such as The Great Divide [and more](https://exploringwild.com/bicycling-across-america-tips/). 

I think it would make sense to "complete" this section of the trip separately and use as much time as possible for it. I think the west to east USA tour could be done in 6-12 months and south to north in 1-3 years depending on ... everything (the route, speed, time spent on each country, amount of countries visited, amount of sidequests done). That would give me an excellent reason to practise my Spanish skills, too.

## Australia

I'm not too excited about Australia yet. I've heard it has the craziest animals and difficult wind conditions. It also has a lot of friendly people and the longest straight road in the world. Wikipedia told me that Australia is the world's sixth-largest country so it has a lot of area. It also has a lot of uninhabitated land and wilderness which isn't exactly suited for bicycling. I'm not a fan of big empty spaces. But to counter that it is the flattest country in the world and a so-called megadiverse country with lots of different climates and landscapes from tropical rainforests to deserts and mountains.

There are many successful routes around or across Australia. Darwin to Melbourne (north-south) is about 4000km. East-west probably cannot be done as a straight line. Mark Beaumont and Jenny Graham cycled approximately from Perth to Sydney along the south coastline of Australia. I would probably follow that same route as I'd like to see something else besides the desert. That route is about 4000km.
[This](https://lunky.com/) awesome dude cycled around Australias coast line for 20 000km if you need inspiration.

Sydney is said to be one of the worst cities for cyclists so be aware.

I'd think 4000km can be done in 2 months but 3 months would be a good investment to make it more enjoyable. Besides, it takes about 20 hours to fly to Australia from Finland so it would be boring to be there for such a short time. Even better idea would be to visit New Zealand right after Australia. 

There is an awesome route across NZ: Tour Aotearea (TA). Read more about it [here](https://www.escapeadventuresnz.com/cycle-tours/tour-aotearoa-cape-reinga-to-bluff/) and [here](http://www.touraotearoa.nz/p/home.html). It's 3000km and you can do it in 1 month if you're hasty. However, there are amazing landscapes and hikes there that I would like to visit such as Mount Cook (3724m). I know from experience that NZ has really steep climbs with bike, too. So 2 months is minimum for the trip to be enjoyable and not just suffering 12 hours a day. Thus, Australia and NZ will take almost 6 months in total.

## Afro-Eurasia

The biggest connected body of land in the planet consisting of 57% of world's land area. That means I can in theory travel around this continent for the rest of my life without ever taking a flight. Let's begin:

![afro-eurasia]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/afro-eurasia.png)

### Europe

My home. I've visited many of the 50-something countries belonging to Europe and cycled there a lot, too. It's easy for me to travel inside EU and ETA since I don't need any visas.

Interesting routes for me would be from the northernmost point of Finland or Norway to Gibraltar, Spain and furter to Morocco and Africa. I have cycled in the Mediterranean and I got bored of it so I rerouted to the Alps. Italy-Slovenia-Croatia-Bosnia&Hertsegovina-Montenegro-Serbia-Kosovo-Albania-Greece would be an interesting one, too. The route spans from sand beaches to mountains and would be at least 3000km depending on how many of these countries I'd like to visit and which part of Italy the route would begin.

Other than that I think I've seen Europe enough and it's time for me to move on to other parts of the world. Seeing the horrors of after-war Ukraine and visiting Chernobyl would be cool indeed. Visiting Russia would be cool one day but not yet. There are some kickass routes from Netherlands to Belgium and to France. There would definitely be cool routes in the Alps that I haven't visited yet. And the Carpathian mountains, too. I've heard lots of good things of Spain and Portugal. Italy is about 1000km long so one could have a long tour there, too. But it's too close. Too familiar. I need to challenge myself.


### Asia

I have never been to Asia. I don't count transferring in Singapore as visiting. But I'd really love to.

My favorite place would be of course Japan. Cycling around it would be about 4000km and it would take a longer time than 2 months since most of the country is mountainous and there are lots of cool places to see. The length of the tourist visa is three months. I think I could try to squeeze my visit to that time and extend it or come back if necessary/possible.

China is a controversial country. I don't say why but I'd really love to visit that country one day. Besides, it's a large country so avoiding it would make a RTW trip a bit difficult. Finnish citizens must apply for a visa to China separately. A single pass tourist visa is 30 days and it can be extended to 90 days.

The traffic in China can be dangerous. The police or the officials cannot be trusted. Internet has been censored. The Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not recommend to travel to China currently.

Korea is interesting at least but there isn't too much to bicycle there until I have to pack everything up in a cargo ship or in an aeroplane. The same goes with Taiwan except I have heard that it's an awesome place for bicyclists, climbers and hikers.

I would like to visit all regions in Asia except North Asia (Siberia) since that area is way too cold and harsh for now. In Western Asia I'd like to visit Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaidjan, Iraq and Iran. I don't know anything about Central Asia (the 'stans) but I'd like to visit some of them. The mountains are a major feature in Central Asia landscape:

![coolmap]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/reddit-cool-map.webp)

Another map shows the borders of the countries:

![central-asia]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Central-Asia-political-physical-elevation-map.webp)

so probably crossing the mountains would be tough but also rewarding as I love the mountains. According to [this](https://visaguide.world/tips/hardest-countries-to-visit/) page Turkmenistan is difficult to get a visa to.

In the South Asia I'd like to visit India, Nepal, maybe Bangladesh. I'm not sure how biker friendly these countries are but one day I'll find out. Hiking in the Himalayan mountains would be a life changing trip. And as South Asia is the most populous and the most population dense geographical region in the world I would experience something completely different than in any other part of the world because of that. Bhutan is [notoriously difficult to get a visa to](https://visaguide.world/tips/hardest-countries-to-visit/).

Finally, in the more islandy South-East Asia I'd like to visit Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam. The islands aren't that appalling to bicycling but I could try that, too. I will do some googling for other people who have visited these areas and update this accordingly.

[worldbiking.info](http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/2018/02/is-it-safe-to-cycle-around-the-world/) does not recommend Thailand or Bangladesh. Some other people have told me that Cambodia is bad.

I used [The Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs](https://um.fi/matkustustiedotteet-a-o) to find out what's going on in each of these countries and it's not looking too good.

- Iraq: risk of terrorism, lots of bombs and mines in forests, foreigners are kidnapped, Iraqi Airways are banned by EU, floods in the winter, sandstorms in the summer, hot and dry
- Iran: political instability and protests, new sanctions to Iran, dangers in borders with Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan

These two countries are also featured in [the worst countries to visit](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/worst-countries-to-visit).

I think I shouldn't be checking information about the security of the countries because otherwise I'll end up travelling nowhere.

### Africa

I have heard lots of good things about Morocco. Peyman from [Nomad's Trails](https://nomadstrails.com/) has been travelling in West Africa across Sahara. He has loved it there so far. East or central Africa doesn't look like a good place at all.

I think I'll do a separate trip to Africa when it's time for that. Covid, extreme weather and Russian attacking Ukraine has done a lot of bad things for Africa so I'm not surprised there is a lot of tension.

## Antarctica

Some people have biked here. I myself am not ready for it yet.

## Other

- Hawaii would be cool
- Polynesia has lots of interesting islands
- Japan is a must-go for me
- Greendland and Iceland are on my bucket list
- Novaja Zemlja is interesting. Definitely not biker friendly but interesting
- I don't know anything about Madagaskar but I'd like to find out
- Taiwan is a good place for bicyclists

That's it. Please don't be offended if the piece of land you love wasn't listed. Please contact me if you think your country is the best place ever for my tour.

# Conclusion on my 'bucket list' of countries and areas

- Start somewhere in Europe
- Prefer not to start from Finland to south to Baltics because I've cycled the Baltics already twice
- Start going from west to east
- Avoid countries flagged as dangerous, in war, unstable or too difficult to get a visa to

Possible route for the first leg:
- Start from Italy
- Go to Croatia and follow the coastline to Bosnia-Montenegro-Albania-Greece
- Start moving towards North-Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey
- Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaidjan, then a ferry to Kazakstan
- Kazakstan does not have any border with Mongolia so try to transit to Mongolia via Russia or China
- End the trip there OR
- try to get to India-Nepal-Myanmar-Thailand-Laos-Cambodia-Vietnam and end the trip there OR
- fly to Japan

Basically move from west to east as long distance as possible.

Australia can be probably reached without a flight by going to Malesia, Singapore, Sumatra, Jakarta and using just ferries. But I'm not sure if that would be in scope of this leg.

Second leg: Americas
Third leg: Australia and NZ
Fourth leg: Morocco to West Africa
Bonus: Japan
Bonus 2: Iceland, Greendland
Bonus 3: Lofotes of Norway
Bonus 4: Nuorgam-Spain or Portugal

# Parameters to optimize

Are you with me so far? If so, it's time to actually plan the route or routes. As I'm an engineer it's essential to decide with respect of which quantity to optimize the route. The most obvious thing is to convert everything to either time or money. If I had an infinite supply of either or both I'd be able to do anything.

A flight from A to B costs money and time. A train from A to B costs money and time. Bicycling in the USA for 100 days costs money and time. Getting a flat tire, eating, working 9-5... you get the idea.

I want to absolutely minimize my monetary costs. I just don't like spending way too much money and I like experiences more than stuff. But I don't need to take helicopter rides and manicures. Just basic stuff. I don't enjoy luxury meals and I'm ok with sleeping in a tent and wildcamping 90% of the time.

Secondly, I don't want to quit my job (yet). I don't think I can. I have been thinking of ways to go around finances, retirement and all that and I don't have an answer yet. I have tried working remotely while bicycle touring, too. I will write about it in another post.

I have some savings so I could in theory just quit my job, sell everything and start touring. But that doesn't feel comfortable to me.

I also want to minimize the amount of flights I take. I think I have done about 20 flights in my life. At one point I totally hated it. At one point I had to travel for work.
Nowadays I'm kind of neutral.
I know it's horrible for the planet and the ecological side is totally another story.
I don't even want to start arguing about it because I think you shouldn't make kids and I also think the big corporations are pushing the responsibility to consumers.
But that's already too many controversial opinions.
I don't like flying and I hate breaking my bicycle in parts, sending it somewhere else in a cardboard box and reassembling it.
That's why I want to stop doing 2-4 week trips 1-2 times a year and start doing 20-40 week trips.

I want to minimize the amount of unnecessary risks I take.
I don't want to visit [dangerous countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-dangerous-countries) such as Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Russia, South Sudan, Somalia or Pakistan.
I mean I really do.
And I think there are some wonderful people in those countries.
But I don't want to be beaten up by the police, get shot, lose my leg to a landmine or stuff like that.
It's my fears and prejudices talking and hopefully for the right reason.

[![dangerous-countries]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/dangerous-countries-map-late-2022.jpg)](https://www.atlasandboots.com/travel-blog/most-dangerous-countries-in-the-world/)

### Weather

I have to find out what kind of climate there is in the countries I visit and maximize the safety and comfort.

### Road condition

I have to micro optimize the route to avoid highways (4 lanes, cars driving 100km/h) and muddy roads.

### Guiness World Records and what is a trip around the world

GWR rules state that the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be 18,000 miles (29,000 km), and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length. Any considerable distance travelled opposite to the direction of the attempt must be discounted from any calculations of the overall distance travelled. The route must be ridden through two approximate antipodal points.

The requirement to pass at least two antipodal points causes some problems in route planning. For example, among popular countries for around-the-world cyclists, the antipodes of Australia is spread out over the Atlantic Ocean, that of North America over the Indian Ocean, that of Africa over mid Pacific Ocean, and that of Europe and most of Asia over the South Pacific Ocean, without any land mass there. Those land areas would not give any opportunities for an antipodal pair while cycling. Some possible pairs are China/Argentina, Malaysia/Peru, and Spain/New Zealand (Madrid and Wellington fall within the ±5-degree difference permitted by Guinness). 

Check the antipodes [here](https://engaging-data.com/antipodes-map/) for example or check the images [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes).
