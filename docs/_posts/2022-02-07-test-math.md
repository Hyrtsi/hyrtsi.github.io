## Testing to use LaTeX in Github Pages created by Jekyll

So I wanted to add LaTeX to a markdown document. I googled it and found out that it's supported and it's pretty simple: just do this

```
$$1+1=2$$
```

When I tried it, the result looked like this:

```
\[1+1=2\] 
```

I googled a bit more and found out that it's not a trivial task.

[The latest news](https://nschloe.github.io/2022/05/20/math-on-github.html) tells us that Github has released Math support in Markdown. Cool. They are using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render it.
