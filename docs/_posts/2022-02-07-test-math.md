## Testing to use LaTeX in Github Pages created by Jekyll

So I wanted to add LaTeX to a markdown document.

### Try 1: just do it

I googled it and found out that it's supported and it's pretty simple: just do this

```
$$1+1=2$$
```

When I tried it, my [local markdown parser in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) was able to render it but the result online on this page looked like this:

```
\[1+1=2\] 
```

I googled a bit more and found out that it's not a trivial task. [Here's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26275645/how-to-support-latex-in-github-pages) a long post on Stackoverflow with lots of outdated solutions.

[The latest news](https://nschloe.github.io/2022/05/20/math-on-github.html) tells us that Github has released Math support in Markdown. Cool. They are using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render it.

### Try 2: `_includes/head.html`

Then I tried adding 

```
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```

to `docs/_includes/head-custom.html`. It didn't work.

### Try 3: add Mathjax script to the `.html` document generated by Jekyll

[This](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-10-How_to_use_LaTeX_in_Markdown/) possibly outdated source told to add

```
<script
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
  type="text/javascript">
</script>

```

to my Markdown document (or... HTML document?). I compiled my page locally and it actually worked.

The steps to do this:

```
cd docs
bundle istall
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then I searched my post `.html` document in `_site` and added the script above to the bottom just before `</html>.

then I opened `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` on my browser and it rendered my LaTeX correctly!

The problem is now: how do I incorporate these changes to remote as `_site` is autogenerated by Jekyll?

The small print says:

```
Just add the HTML code to your layout definition files, e.g., single.html or post.html, and MathJax support gets enabled on all your pages that use these layouts.
```

### Try 4: use layouts incorrectly

[The Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) was the next place I went looking. It says:
- create `_layouts` folder (if you haven't got it already)
- add `default.html` which will be the default for your posts
- add `post.html` that inherits `default.html` to use for all posts
- edit those files accordingly

Then I really went and created those files. But I didn't know what to put there. So I left them empty and compiled my page locally. Then the pages were just blank. Wtf.

### Try 5: use layouts correctly by taking the theme into account

Then I realized that I have to write all the html myself to those files if I want to render anything. I haven't created my own layouts myself but rather used [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). So I realized that I can 
- copy their implementiation of `_layouts` [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts)
- paste it to my files
- add the script

```
<script
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
  type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

to `_layouts/default.html` to the end just before the `</html>` tag. I tried adding it to `_layouts/post.html` but that didn't end up well.

Remember that any time you can debug your page by building it locally and checking the generated `.html` files in `_site/` after that.

and just like magic, then my LaTeX worked just fine. Remember that not all LaTeX packages are supported by MathJax. Read more [here](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/) and [here](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/macros/index.html).

### It works!

$$ 1+1 = 2 $$

$$ x^2 = 1 $$

$$f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint\frac{f(z)}{z-a}dz$$

$$\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{F} =
            \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i}
          + \left( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) \mathbf{j}
          + \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k}$$
