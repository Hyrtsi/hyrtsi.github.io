## Testing to use LaTeX in Github Pages created by Jekyll

So I wanted to add LaTeX to a markdown document. I googled it and found out that it's supported and it's pretty simple: just do this

```
$$1+1=2$$
```

When I tried it, the result looked like this:

```
\[1+1=2\] 
```

$$ 1+1 = 2 $$

$ x = 4 $

$$ x^2 = 1 $$

I googled a bit more and found out that it's not a trivial task.

[The latest news](https://nschloe.github.io/2022/05/20/math-on-github.html) tells us that Github has released Math support in Markdown. Cool. They are using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render it.

I also tried adding 

```
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```

to `docs/_includes/head-custom.html`. It didn't work.

[This](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-10-How_to_use_LaTeX_in_Markdown/) possibly outdated source told to add

```
<script
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
  type="text/javascript">
</script>

```

to my Markdown document (or... HTML document?). I compiled my page locally and it actually worked.

```
cd docs
bundle istall
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then I searched my post `.html` document in `_site` and added the script above to the bottom just before `</html>.

then I opened `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` on my browser and it rendered my LaTeX correctly!

The problem is now: how do I incorporate these changes to remote as `_site` is autogenerated by Jekyll?
