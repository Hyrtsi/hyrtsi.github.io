## How to make your `github.io` page visible on Google search:

- Go to https://search.google.com
- Add property
- Paste your github url there
- Download their html file. Let's call it `1234.html`.
- Add it to your website so that `https://<username>.github.io/1234.html` is reachable by their bot
  - This happens by merely adding the `.html` file provided to your project root.
- Add your changes to git
- Open the html file using your browser in an incognito window
  - For example, if the file was `1234.html` open `https://<username>.github.io/1234.html`
