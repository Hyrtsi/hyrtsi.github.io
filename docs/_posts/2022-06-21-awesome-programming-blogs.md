# Awesome programming blogs

Nothing's better than reading rants and insights about programming, computer science and Silicon Valley lyfe while your testsuite is running and you have a cup of coffee in front of you.

Here are my favorite programming blogs. It's a list I will update regularly.

## [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)

Co-founder of Trello and Stack Overflow. Lots of posts about startups, software design, recruiting and more.

## [Viznut](http://viznut.fi/en/)

A crazy Finnish hacker who's been to demoscene for a long time, wrote the [countercomplex](http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/) blog and made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCRPUv8V22o) awesome tool for creating audiovisual programs with a very short piece of code.

## [Computer vision](https://computervisionblog.wordpress.com/)

A blog I found recently. Lots of new papers on computer vision.

## [Learn OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/)

My goto resource on learning to do things with OpenCV.

To be continued ...
