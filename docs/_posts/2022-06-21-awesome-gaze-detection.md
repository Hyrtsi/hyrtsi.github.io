# Awesome gaze detection repositories

List of high quality github repositories for determining human eye gaze direction from an image.

I have ranked the repos according to their usefulness with these metrics:
- Does the repo have a trained model or do you have to train your model from scratch to test the code?
- Does the repo have a good README with installation guide or do you have to guess how to install it?
- Is the repo related to a research paper of a university research team or is it just the code?
- Does the repo have high quality, commented, tested and readable code or is it just wild west junk

Keywords to help you find some good repos on Google or Github search:
