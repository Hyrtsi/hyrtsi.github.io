# Awesome gaze detection repositories

List of high quality github repositories for determining human eye gaze direction from an image.

I have ranked the repos according to their usefulness with these metrics:
- Does the repo have a trained model or do you have to train your model from scratch to test the code?
- Does the repo have a good README with installation guide or do you have to guess how to install it?
- Is the repo related to a research paper of a university research team or is it just the code?
- Does the repo have high quality, commented, tested and readable code or is it just wild west junk

Keywords to help you find some good repos on Google or Github search:

## GazeML

[swook/GazeML](https://github.com/swook/GazeML)

- 游릭 Has a trained model
- 游릭 Has a README with installation guide

## pytorch-mpiigaze-demo

[hysts/pytorch_mpiigaze_demo](https://github.com/hysts/pytorch_mpiigaze_demo)

An awesome repo containing demo for MPIIGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, ETH-XGaze. It is really easy to install for demos: just install it with pip. However, forking the code required a bit effort for me.

- 游릭 Has a trained model
- 游리 Has a README with installation guide
  - The README is awesome, it has a lot of gifs, installation guide and CLI args helper
  - However, the README does not help you if you want to fork the code, edit it and run it on your system
- 游릭 Is related to a research paper
- 游릭 Has good quality code
