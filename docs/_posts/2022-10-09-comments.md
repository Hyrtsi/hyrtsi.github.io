I am using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) free plan. It's currently the most suitable option for me even though there are multiple other options out there including programming my own comment section.

# Steps to use

- Register to the site
- Create a new page
  - Choose your shortname
- Choose `jekyll` from the list of possible pages
- Copy the following to your `_config.yml`

```
disqus:
  shortname: yourshortname
```

where `yourshortname` is [your Disqus short name](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname).

Done! You might have to allow the Disqus comment section in your browser security extensions' updates to see it on your browser.
