Having a comment section enables the author and the audience to discuss with each other and build a community around the topic. However, filtering spambots and hate speech let alone implementing the comment section can be troublesome.

I am using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) free plan. It's currently the most suitable option for me even though there are multiple other options out there including programming my own comment section.

According to [g2.com](https://www.g2.com/categories/commenting-systems) some of the best commenting systems are
- Disqus
- IntenseDebate
- Viafoura
- Hyvor Talks

but in reality there are dozens of options available. It took me only 5 minutes to get Disqus up and running.

# Steps to use Disqus in Jekyll

- Register to the site
- Create a new page
  - Choose your shortname
- Choose `jekyll` from the list of possible pages
- Copy the following to your `_config.yml`

```
disqus:
  shortname: yourshortname
```

where `yourshortname` is [your Disqus short name](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname).

Done! You might have to allow the Disqus comment section in your browser security extensions' updates to see it on your browser.
