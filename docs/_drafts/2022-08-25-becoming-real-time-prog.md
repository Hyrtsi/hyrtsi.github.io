From the very beginning of my programmer career I have applied to a plethora of jobs, been to dozens of interviews and gotten many job offers.
Each time I've been to an interview the interviewer has asked me:

Are you more of a frontend programmer, backend programmer or full stack programmer?

I think that question is kind of only valid for web developers but that might be incorrect since I'm not a web developer.
I mean desktop applications also require an user interface and some data processing.
It's technically correct to call a Qt UI programmer or a mobile app UI programmer a frontend person, right?
Remember: this comes from somebody who got confused of that question.
Why do you differentiate programmers with such taxonomy in the first place?

Are frontend programmers the only people who know how to make an application beautiful and usable?
Don't the frontend programmers know how to implement a quadtree or save the values in the UI to a .csv file?
How is it possible that there are these wizards who know how to handle both tech stacks?
Why do all companies hunt these fullstack unicorns?

My first touch to programming is actually a html course I did back in the elementary school.
I don't know almost any css.
I drew a lot as a kid with pencils and watercolors.
I think I have an eye for aesthetics even though I don't know the golden rules of UI and UX.
So I don't automatically label myself as a frontend engineer and I don't actively look for such positions.
I did, however, create the UI for a Windows desktop application using Qt.
And I have created the UIs for all the applications I've created.

You see, at some point I got interested in simulations.
My friend taught me c++ and I wanted to visualize the results somehow.
I created a world with these circles that represent animals.
The animals move freely in the world, there's collision physics and they eat food and kill each others.
Quite basic.
I used SFML for creating a window and visualizing that.

I have a dozen of apps that are visualized using SFML and the UI of which I designed myself from scratch.
No HTML or CSS involved.
So am I a full stack engineer then?
Depends if you want a person who knows specific tech stacks or who is capable of doing two person's work.

My professional existential crisis does not end there.
You see, there isn't a word for a person who codes c++ and python.
Other than a backend engineer, of course.
But who also knows OpenGL and writes shaders to do cool stuff.
Or finds SFML and ImGui from Github and uses them to draw rotating cubes and demos.

I hate coming up with names and labels for things but could we have a common name for this?
I must not be the only one who's concerned.
Thank you.
