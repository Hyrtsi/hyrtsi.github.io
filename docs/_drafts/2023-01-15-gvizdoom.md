We are developing an AI that plays Doom 2 from raw pixel input.
Unlike many other AI models this one does not memorize the maps but can play any doom map.
We claim that we are the first research team to do so.
Furthermore, the solution we present will be able to play any FPS from raw pixel input.

In order to train such AI model we need some tools.
We started the whole thing using [vizdoom](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom), a [gzdoom](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom) -based AI research platform.
It has the API to run episodes, access the pixel and depth buffer, get labels of game objects and do actions in the game.
Just what we need.

We use both the original doom2 maps and automatically generated maps using [PyOblige](https://github.com/mwydmuch/PyOblige), a python wrapper for [OBLIGE](https://oblige.sourceforge.net/).
Being able to generate an endless amount of random maps is useful: our bot will not simply memorize the maps we are training it on.
It has to generalize and actually learn to play.
