There are these common programmer interview questions. They're always about recursion, stack, data structures, algorithms, tree traversal and more.

I haven't used or created or done a single database in my programming career.

I haven't made a single webpage professionally.

I haven't made a single HTTP request / REST API call professionally.

I haven't implemented a linked list traversal, tree search or hashmap.

I mostly use c++ std vector, map, python dict, for loops, classes and functions. That's it.

So my big question is:
- why do programmers need these skills?
- why haven't I needed them?

I have programmed during my professional programming career
- A Windows desktop app with Qt and c++
- A XML parser utility that unzips a file and then reads the contents
- Obstacle avoidance path planning algorithm for robots
- Functionality and logic for a forklift truck that picks pallets in a warehouse
- 5G L1 algorithms for eCPRI RT
- Computer vision tests for a automotive SoC test suite
