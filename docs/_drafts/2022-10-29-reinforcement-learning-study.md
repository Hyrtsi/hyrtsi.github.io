I want to make a bot be able to walk in Doom.

What should I do?

My inputs: rgb frames. One or several frames at once.

My outputs: WASD, turning, use (to open doors and complete the level).

Goal: I want the bot to be able to navigate.

Does navigation require ... anything fancy? Shouldn't the bot be able to learn to avoid walls, walk around, find the exit?

I started this tutorial series: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/introduction.html

and after reading the basics (which I already partly knew) I started with policy gradient chapter: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro3.html

I found an amazing tutorial for Policy Gradients here: https://towardsdatascience.com/policy-gradients-in-reinforcement-learning-explained-ecec7df94245
