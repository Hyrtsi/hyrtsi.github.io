I've been cycling 70'000km in 15 countries at the time of writing this.
Most of these kilometers have been done with two bicycles.
I'm going to discuss here which properties you should take into account and how you can find the right bike for you.
I think personally that it's like the wands in Harry Potter: the bike chooses you.
You shouldn't ultimately listen to anyone else or believe anyone elses advice.
The best way to choose the right tool for the job is to try a few, give them some serious action and see how well they work in the wild.
Let's get into it.

We need to understand the requirements first.
Note that these are highly personal and you have to make your own list.
This is mine for inspiration.

# Requirements

- The bike must cost less than 3000 euros
- The bike must last in the intended use for more than 5 years of time without breaking totally. Individual parts may fail earlier.
- The bike must be able to withstand thousands of kilometers of riding without service (other than the chain)
- The bike is used on road (tarmac) and light gravel.
- The bike must not weigh more than 18kg without any bags but with all parts such as racks.
- The bike must be able to carry at least 50kg of weight in addition to the rider and its own weight
- I must be able to attach my Ortlieb panniers to the bike
- The riding posture must be comfortable for long distances and up to 12 hours of cycling a day
- I must be able to change the grip
- I must be able to climb steep hills with the bike
- I must be able to take the bike inside an aeroplane as my luggage
- The bike must have parts that are durable and easily replacable

## Not requirements

- I don't want to do any downhill riding
- I don't want to do any offroad riding such as single track
- The bike doesn't have to have springs in the fork or the frame
- The bike doesn't need to have any electricity such as motors, batteries, integrated dynamos, chargers or lights
- I don't have to do 200km a day or ride really fast (such as 30km/h average speed)

That's it. There are dozens of bikes that fulfil these categories.
The genres of such bikes are
- Touring bikes
- Trekking bikes
- Gravel bikes
- Bikepacking

You may use those keywords to find something that suits to your needs if many of the requirements sounded like your cup of tea.

# Frame

The most important thing about a bicycle is the frame.
I didn't understand this first.
I tried to use a bike with a wrong frame type to bicycle touring and got into many troubles.

It's easier to carry lots of luggage with a bike with big wheelbase.
Wheelbase means the distance of the wheels.

Frame must be strong enough to carry the weight.

The frame must have the required attachment slots for racks, bottle holders and such.
The frame geometry must support a comfortable riding posture and curved handlebars.
