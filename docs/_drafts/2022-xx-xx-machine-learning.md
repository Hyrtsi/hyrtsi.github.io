## Learning machine learning from scratch

I have been fascinated about machine learning for almost a decade now. However, I still don't think I understand even a fraction of the field. I have spent the majority of my focus in software engineering, robotics, c++ and mathematics. They do indeed support ML but they don't make me a ML guru.

I was thinking really hard what would be the optimal entry for me in the ML scene and how I could employ my current skillset (robotics, c++, real-time, embedded) to ML. You see, I didn't want to start at a junior position. I realized the perfect intersection between my skills and my dream job would be computer vision.

I have no plans on getting a second degree in university. Instead, I will be self studying machine learning, neural networks and computer vision. I feel like learning "machine learning" or "AI" or "neural networks" is a bit like learning jazz or rock climbing.

1. You can't learn it unless you can define it
2. You can only learn a fraction of it in your lifetime
3. There is no one way to learn it
4. You learn the best by doing

I'd like to share my progress with you guys. It's a lot easier for me to start learning ML since I have already a solid background in programming, visualization, python, c++, ubuntu, math and statistics. If you don't have that background I suggest you to:

- Get a university degree in engineering, math, computer science, physics or similar
- Get a decent PC with a beefy GPU
- Watch one of those 3 hour videos of python basics
- Study the basic course on digital signal processing, calculus and linear algebra
- [This](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) is the book I used to learn backpropagation
- [This](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) is just amazing and beautiful video that explains visually how neural networks learn. I suggest you to watch the whole series
- [This](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a free book on deep learning that covers all the basics you need

There's a lot of topics but remember: it's not a sprint. It's a marathon. Remember to keep it interesting for you. Always have a project that is challenging but not too difficult. That helps you to learn and motivates you to study additional skills. Imagine studying Spanish and then using your language skills in Spain. How motivating would that be instead of using your Spanish only inside the classroom?

I start by focusing on **computer vision** and **reinforcement learning**.

Computer vision topics that are of interest to me:
- Feature detection
- Autoencoders and compressing image
- Segmentation
- Semantic understanding of the image
- Creating images based on text input
- Character recognition

Reinforcement learning topics:
- Alphago, muzero and similar. Playing board games using AI
- Playing FPS games using AI (such as Minecraft, Doom)
- Exploration vs exploitation
- State-of-the-art algorithms for tasks with big action space

There will be more posts on my journey and my study notes. Stay tuned.
