The game of go. 2500 years old Chinese game. Perhaps the oldest game that humans have played continuously to this date.

I really got into the game was when I saw ![this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) documentary about AlphaGo, a machine learning model that beats professional human go players.
I did two things immediately after I watched the document: 
- I started learning the rules of go and playing it passionately. I also joined my local go club
- I started developing my own go AI using python and machine learning

You can learn the rules [here](https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go), [here](https://www.learn-go.net/), [here](https://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/learning_go/learning_go_1.html). It takes you about 5 minutes to understand the basics and I suggest you do it right away before continuing to read this article.

You can see the game of go two ways:
- A territorial game: you're trying to get as many territory points as possible while preventing your opponent from making territory or destroying their territory
- A game of life and death: you're trying to create living groups and threatening your opponents groups with death

I think the first definition is more easy to understand for beginners. However, the second definition is more important after you've learned the basics.

## Learning the game of go

There is a proverb that you must try to lose your first 1000 games as fast as possible.
It's true.
This game is so difficult that you will lose a lot of games in the beginning.
The best way to learn go is to play a lot.
I tried to hack my way through it by studying tsumegos (go puzzles for practise) and coming up with some crazy ideas but it doesn't save me from playing a lot.

I have played 101 ranked games on [OGS](https://online-go.com), maybe 100 games of [GoQuest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.wars.goquest&hl=en&gl=US) and maybe 20 games IRL.
I have solved a thousand tsumegos.
So I still have a long way to go.

I have been thinking of more creative ways to study.
Ones that are closer to what the game is.
Or ones that have a little bit better gradient than the usual ways of learning.
You can learn weight lifting by practising with too heavy weights but it's slow and dangerous.
You can also learn go by playing a lot of meaningless games and losing a lot. 
However, you also may get demotivated.
What if there was always the best and optimal practise for your current level and set of skills?
What if there were perfect exercises that train your weaknesses that are holding you down?
I believe that seeing ones own improvement is so motivating that it can be used as a fuel for learning.
Imagine that I put you through some simple well-selected exercises for any skill in life (not just go) 5 minutes a day and then I will prove you that after 2 weeks you have improved.
How motivating would that be?
Really motivating if you ask me.

My ideas for accelerated learning:
- Measure progress but don't measure too much
- Make it easy and trivial to practise. Too easy so you will not skip training ever
- Make a lot of repetitions. A lot.
- Maximize high quality training with high focus instead of rubbish volume when you're tired
- Build a skilltree that shows clear goals and how your individual skills are doing

I will update here some of my ideas for practising, playing as well as a list of resources.
If you're a relatively new player like me:
- Play every day when you're feeling the most energized and focused
- Play against humans even though there are a lot of bots
- Don't fear losing. Don't skip playing because losing makes you feel bad emotionally
- Start with playing only on the 9x9 board. It will help you significantly later when you're switching to the 13x13 or 19x19 board
- If you know with > 95% probability that you've lost the game, resign, thank your opponent, take a break and analyze your game or start a new one
  - You need a lot of repetitions. No need to "waste" your time in a game that will gain you nothing
  - Yes, losing isn't bad. But if you make a big mistake on move 5 it will haunt you for the rest of the game as in go you can't remove your stones
- Study tsumegos. Reading is the most important skill in the game. Don't cheat. Don't guess. Honestly try to imagine and visualize the whole sequence in your head with all the possibilities. It's hard I know. But you can apply this skill really fast in the real games and you'll feel like a king when you outread your opponents and kill their groups or make your invasion live inside their territory.
- Have fun. If the game isn't fun quit it and start playing tennis or collecting post stamps. Really.

## AI Go

I'm a programmer. So like all other developers I have had the idea of using computer's crunching power to play the game of go. You know what? The game is notoriously difficult to brute force.

Actually there are more unique go games than atoms in the universe. Some computational facts about go:
- There are about 10^172 unique board positions in go
- Thus no two same go games exist
- A go game can last practically forever
- About 1% of the all possible board positions are legal according to the rules of go making the legal board positions be around 10^170 which is still a huge number
- A typical game between experts is about 150 moves with an average of 250 choices per move
- The longest professional game is 411 moves and the theoretically longest game is 10^48 moves. 

More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_and_mathematics) and [here](https://senseis.xmp.net/?NumberOfPossibleGoGames).

Is this enough to convince you that it's a difficult game to play even with computers?

The whole meta of go changed in 2015-2017 when AlphaGo was introduced.

# Getting better

How do I measure my strengths and weaknesses? What are some measurable skills
- By playing the game
- By measuring how long sequences can I read
- By measuring the power of my intuition
- By measuring how long it takes me to memorize a sequence or board state or game
- By measuring how long it takes me to solve a problem

As a developer and engineer it strikes my curiosity and motivation to create a plot graph of my skills getting better every week.
I would like to change the way go is teached even though I am a total beginner in it.

Which individual skills are there in go?
- Reading
  - Life and death
- Shape
- Intuition
- Fighting
- Territorial awareness
- Joseki
- Controlling ones emotions
- Terminology

Here's a sample: I have to solve a 1d tsumego.
If I can do it that doesn't mean I'm 1D.
But it's a way to tell if I have improved or not.
I can measure myself in binary: whether I can solve it or not.
Or I can measure how many tries it takes me to solve the problem if it's automated.
Or I can measure how long it does take me to find the solution.
Or even better: I can measure how many 1D problems I can solve in 5 minutes.
