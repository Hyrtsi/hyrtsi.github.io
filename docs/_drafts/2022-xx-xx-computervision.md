# Computer vision study material

I am fascinated about vision, the ability to see. It is a fundamental skill for many animals including us. Even though computer vision has been around for a long time I don't believe the field has matured into our every day use.

I have decided to steer my career into computer vision direction. I will study all the necessary skills in mathematics, programming, physics to become a master in that field.

I will share the material I studied and the projects that I created.
