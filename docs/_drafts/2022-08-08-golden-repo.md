# Towards a perfect github repository ðŸ’Ž

Github is the place to be for open-source programmers. Learning to use Git and Github are amongst the most important steps during my programming career. Luckily I started using git for my projects early on as it's a skill and it has to be practised a lot. On the other hand it has exposed me to the programming community. There are some immensely useful, popular and cool repositories. But there are also some quite mundane repositories that are not useful to anyone. I want to dissect the elemenst of a perfect github repository.

# README

[README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) is a fundamental part of software. A lot of intelligence, time and experimentation has been poured to every project so all of its details are not evident to people reading the software for the first time.

Your job as a software engineer is to try to explain your work in many levels of abstraction as well as possible. The lowest level is the programming language and the highest level is documentation in plain terms. There are several levels of abstraction between those two such as commenting the code, function and file names, user inferfaces, requirements and tests.

Programming is essentially communicating. It is trying to formulate a problem using some special language. You're trying to explain the processor how to control the electricity by splitting the problem into pieces and different levels of abstraction. When I was doing my Master's thesis I rewrote my software several times. Each time I realized that my code was a huge mess written by someone who didn't understand the problem fully. As I learned more about the problem my implementation became clearer and clearer.

So I conclude that you cannot create code that is easy to understand before you understand the problem itself. Are you solving the problem the right way? Are you even solving the right problem? Are you even supposed to solve that problem to begin with? (It's too common that engineers are solving problems that normal people do not even know or care about)
