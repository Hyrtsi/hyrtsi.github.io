This post is part of my [bicycling series]({% post_url bicycling %})

I have planned bicycling routes for long bicycle tours using Google Maps and Eurovelo routes.
However,
- Google Maps doesn't always give any bicycling route at all in some countries or on mobile
- Eurovelo is amazing but it only covers Europe
- If you're on a multi year trip you want to consider the weather in some parts and travel certain countries or areas only during the best time of the year
- Depending on your bike you want to only ride on paved roads or maximize dirt and forest
- You might want to search popular car and truck routes and avoid them
- You need local information about dangerous wild animals, landslides and similar

All of this will be part of my new amazing route planning application. I have two ideas:

1. RateMyRoute
2. ZenCycling

## RateMyRoute

Imagine if your favorite route planner gives you this proposal for route:

![fin-to-es]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/fin-to-es.jpg)

Is it a good route?
Depends on what you want: the shortest, fastest, less elevation changes, best concrete, safest, most beautiful, most quiet, least cars, least pollution.
We can agree on the following:
- All cyclists want to avoid countries that are notoriously difficult to get a visa into (Turkmenistan, North Korea, Russia)
- All cyclists want to avoid war, minefields, riots, violence, protests, natural disasters and exploded nuclear power plants
- It would be nice to get 1-3 suggestions for the route and explanations why certain choices have been made
- It would be nice to discuss about a route with other cyclists, comment route segments and add suggestions

This is the base philosophy of RateMyRoute (the name can still change).

## ZenCycling

ZenCycling is my standalone bicycle route planner. It takes certain parameters into account such as the ones mentioned above in RateMyRoute.
It can be used as the route planning engine in RateMyRoute but it is fundamentally different from RateMyRoute in the fact that RateMyRoute is a social media app for cyclists and ZenCycling is not.
ZenCycling is more like Google Maps with better path planning for cyclists.
RateMyRoute is more like git code review for cycling paths: you can discuss about the routes with other people and suggest changes.

## Sounds cool! When are these apps available?

I'm working as a full time tech lead on Basemark 9-5 currently. So not anytime soon. I estimate that it will take me 2 years to plan my route around the world manually. These two applications are part of my planning. Implementing them will definitely take some time.
If you're a cyclist and/or programmer and would like to use, comment, collaborate or donate to this work, please let me know.

## Market research

But why am I inventing wheel again? Aren't there already a dozen apps that do what I want? Why should I create another app?
