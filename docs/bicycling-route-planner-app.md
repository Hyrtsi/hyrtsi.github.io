This post is part of my [bicycling series](https://hyrtsi.github.io/bicycling/).

I have planned bicycling routes for long bicycle tours using Google Maps and Eurovelo routes.
However,
- Google Maps doesn't always give any bicycling route at all in some countries or on mobile
- Eurovelo is amazing but it only covers Europe
- If you're on a multi year trip you want to consider the weather in some parts and travel certain countries or areas only during the best time of the year
- Depending on your bike you want to only ride on paved roads or maximize dirt and forest
- You might want to search popular car and truck routes and avoid them
- You need local information about dangerous wild animals, landslides and similar

All of this will be part of my new amazing route planning application. I have two ideas:

1. RateMyRoute
2. ZenCycling

## RateMyRoute

Imagine if your favorite route planner gives you this proposal for route:

![fin-to-es]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/fin-to-es.jpg)

Is it a good route?
Depends on what you want: the shortest, fastest, less elevation changes, best concrete, safest, most beautiful, most quiet, least cars, least pollution.
We can agree on the following:
- All cyclists want to avoid countries that are notoriously difficult to get a visa into (Turkmenistan, North Korea, Russia)
- All cyclists want to avoid war, minefields, riots, violence, protests, natural disasters and exploded nuclear power plants
- It would be nice to get 1-3 suggestions for the route and explanations why certain choices have been made
- It would be nice to discuss about a route with other cyclists, comment route segments and add suggestions

This is the base philosophy of RateMyRoute (the name can still change).

## ZenCycling

ZenCycling is my standalone bicycle route planner. It takes certain parameters into account such as the ones mentioned above in RateMyRoute.
It can be used as the route planning engine in RateMyRoute but it is fundamentally different from RateMyRoute in the fact that RateMyRoute is a social media app for cyclists and ZenCycling is not.
ZenCycling is more like Google Maps with better path planning for cyclists.
RateMyRoute is more like git code review for cycling paths: you can discuss about the routes with other people and suggest changes.

## Sounds cool! When are these apps available?

I'm working as a full time tech lead on Basemark 9-5 currently. So not anytime soon. I estimate that it will take me 2 years to plan my route around the world manually. These two applications are part of my planning. Implementing them will definitely take some time.
If you're a cyclist and/or programmer and would like to use, comment, collaborate or donate to this work, please let me know.

## Market research

But why am I inventing wheel again? Aren't there already a dozen apps that do what I want? Why should I create another app?

![xkcd-standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

I don't think the other apps have what it takes. But here we go. I have downloaded all the major mobile apps and I have tested them. Here are the results


### AllTrails

An awesome app. But it is not suitable for planning routes around the world. It is more like a collection of shorter trails of a few kilometers to tens of kilometers.

### Bicycle Route Navigator

A beautiful app with almost 47,000 miles of cycling routes throughout North America. If you need routes there this is your app. You have a selection of free routes and the option to buy more routes. If you want to travel around the world this app will cover only a small portion of your route. Nonetheless it's worth having.

### Bikemap

We used this map a lot on our way from Finland to Romania along East Europe. It's good. But it's not perfect. Sometimes it directed us to quite bad road.

It has a lot of good features
- Offline maps
- Navigation

Most importantly this is first application of the ones I've reviewed so far that is capable of actually getting you navigated around the world.

### BikeTracker

A GPS app that can measure your speed. Not a route planner.

### Cyclers

What a name for an app.
It's simple, minimalistic and looks neat.
I tried to create a route from Kaunas to Suwalki and it said `the route planner is not available`.
What a bummer.
Kaunas-Vilnius worked fine. It shows the route match, distance, ride time, energy, elevation profile, saved emissions, surface and traffic.
The app also lets you edit the planned route manually.

### Eurovelo

Eurovelo has their own app.
However, it's not so good.
I wouldn't recommend using it for planning routes or navigating because that app doesn't have those features.

### Google Maps

I love this app. Maybe a bit too much. I should review the mobile and the browser versions separately.

### Komoot

### Ride With GPS

Recording routes is the main feature of this app.
Then you have a collection of routes recorded by the users.
Saving and navigating routes created with route planned requires a paid account.
However, you can create routes with a free account.
Creating the routes is quite fast. It shows the length of the route, elevation profile and amount of paved vs unpaved.
There is no option to choose between options such as maximum amount of paved, fastest route, least climbing.
I tried a couple of routes and even though the UI is minimal and the options nonexistent the routes were quite good.
The route planner option was hidden quite well.


### Openstreetmap

### https://www.plotaroute.com/

### Strava

### Osmand

### Paper maps

Yes. The good old physical ones. This isn't a mobile app.

- Find them in the local bookstores or gas stations or order online if they even exist
- Cut the unnecessary parts away (if any)
- Mark POIs with a pen
- Protect them from weather
- Have fun

Another option that I used to do back in the days: take a photo of the maps with your smartphone and access the maps via image viewer.
You can do so in aeroplane mode and with battery saver.
I did this when hiking and it totally saved my battery.
No GPS though so you have to stay awake.
Shouldn't be too difficult if you have a lot of straight road and easy landmarks to follow.

### Maps.me


(More to come later)


Reddit u/lightbulbphone says: "From Turkey eastwards you're hardly navigating with much difficulty as there's only a few roads you can take!"

### Offline maps

There are dozens and dozens of offline map apps.
For routes with simple, linear path planning you can consider one of these.

### OsmAnd

This looked like an app for primarly offline maps. But it also has google maps -like planning for bicycles, cars and pedestrians.
This app will not let you plan route unless you download the necessary maps for that route. 
So for a route around the world prepare to download a few gigabytes of maps first.
All in all looks like a basic and decent app.
