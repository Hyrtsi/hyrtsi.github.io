Hi. I'm Eljas Hyyrynen, a robotics M.Sc. I'm enthusiastic about programming, math, bicycling, music and more.

There is a lot of information on programming in our hands. I've learned most of my skills from random stackoverflow posts and blogs similar than this. I think I have to pay back to the community by saving your time and presenting my work here.

Most of the fundamental questions about programming have already been asked on stackoverflow and there are great peer-reviewed and edited solutions for them. There are also good books and publications if you're into those. I have to stick to more practical way of adding value: presenting quick and clean solutions to some obscure problems that I haven't found a neat solution anywhere.
