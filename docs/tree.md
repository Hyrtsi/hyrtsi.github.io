I am looking for funding for my bicycle tour around the world.
You can help me by buying me a coffee.
For every coffee bought I will plant a tree.
Your own personal tree.
For monthly supporters I promise regular updates of the tree where
I show the growth process.

# [ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ Plant Me A Tree ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿](https://buymeacoffee.com/eljas)

## Why

I need funding for my trip and the planet needs trees.
Many people use buymeacoffee.com.
I figured I'd use it too.
But it feels weird to ask money from people if I don't give something back.
I will give you free content without asking payment beforehand.
But I think it'd be more exciting if we did something together.
You pay the seed and I will take care of the rest.

The environmental impact of planting a tree is significant.
Trees
- prevent erosion of the soil
- turn carbon dioxide into oxygen
- are part of the ecosystem and thus support other life
- increase biodiversity
- are beautiful and intelligent living beings
- play a big role in fighting climate change

We wouldn't exist without them.

## Where

In order to give long term support the trees need to be planted in Finland.
Despite its northern location Finland is a perfect place for forests.
In fact more than 75% of Finland's land area is covered with forest.

If I am travelling I will either plant the tree where I am or ask my friends and family to plant the tree in Finland.

I would love to plant trees where they are needed the most: areas with drought, erosion and big tree losses.
However, such areas are currently beyond my capabilities.
We would have to make a bigger campaign for that.
Right now I want to start small: every planted tree is still a planted tree.

## Cost

I will ask you 5 euros for a single tree.
It will cost me around 1 euro for the sapling (including VAT).
All travelling and labor costs are on me.
I don't have a car so I will use either public or muscle powered transportation.
I will buy all saplings and seeds from trusted local stores.

## Monthly subscription

I challenge you to take this challenge seriously.
If you support me every month there will be a new tree every month.
Twelve trees a year.
All of them by you and me.
I will plant them so that it's possible 

## Disclaimers

I will buy the cheapest saplings I can find.
They will have the same positive impact nonetheless.
I will try to change the species but for practical purposes I will stick to:
- Birch (Betula pubescens)
- Evergreen (Picea abies)
- Pine (Pinus sylvestris)

They will survive the harsh Finnish winter and have been part of the ecosystem here forever and will continue like that thanks to you and me.

It is possible to plant trees that have grown for longer.
They are also bigger which may have a positive psychological effect.
However, they are also 100 times more expensive.
Thus, I will not buy those trees as I don't have money for that.

Life in the nature is about fighting for your life.
It may be that after planting the seed it doesn't grow.
It may be that an animal will eat it.
It may be that a storm, too warm or cold or dry or wet weather kills it.
I cannot guarantee that it will be there in 50 years.
We may not be here either.
Thus, I promise to do my best to plant them safely but I will not promise anything beyond that.
The professional people in forestry usually plant hundreds of trees per hectare for this.

I might not be able to plant the tree right after you support me but will do it as soon as possible.
I will do the planting in batches for obvious reasons.
