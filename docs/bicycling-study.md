# Review on all people who have cycled around the world (or are currently trying to)

Guiness World Record breakers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_world_cycling_record).

Thomas Stevens was the first person to ride a bicycle around the world. It took him three years. He started from San Francisco and worked his way from west to east.

Juliana Buhring did 18000 miles in 152 days visiting 4 continents and 19 countries. Surprisingly little amount of countries don't you think for such a long trip? I couldn't find a picture or a satellite map of her journey but this instead:

Italy is the starting point then:
-France
-Spain
-Portugal
-USA
-New Zealand
-Australia
-Malaysia
-Thailand
-India
-Turkey
-Greece
-Macedonia
-Albania
-Montenegro
-Bosnia
-Croatia
-Slovenia

Nick Sanders has cycled and motorcycled around the world seven times. I could not find his bicycle route for his 1981 or 1984 bike tours.

[Alastair Humphreys](https://alastairhumphreys.com/roundtheworldbybike/) did plan an awesome route. He really did take his time while bicycling 4 years in 4 continents, 60 countries and 46000 miles.

Her route can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1O6SspQxUOnoY-vKPOMbJJvAHG48&ll=25.63024166338775%2C117.47976895922443&z=2).
